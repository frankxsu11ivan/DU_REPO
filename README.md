# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	The project overview is the creation of two analysis deliverables in a KickStart Spread sheet with PNG verification of the charts.
### Purpose
	The purpose is to sharpen and review proficiency in excel. Excel is the first tool used in boot camp for data analysis and visualization.
## Analysis and Challenges
	Challenges are structured around modules using pivot  tables and charting the analysis. 
	The data sets are given and consist of project to start discovering trends. 
	Challenges i encountered while using excel were typically errors in syntax. 
	working through office hours and at study session-(#In groups)- i was able to see different approaches, work through solutions and correcting line item syntax errors.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	the analysis of outcomes based on lauch dates is a hoot.
	my solution is based on following the documentation in the module.

	the challenge that i encountered in this sheet was keeping the filters aligned to get the graphs to behave.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	the analysis of outcomes based on launch goals is a bit mor complicated..
	my solution is based on following the documentation in the module, however a challenge i encountered was that i tried to get a loop to grab the goal in column A.

		reverted to individual >= for each amount.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	the challenges are inexperience in pivot tables and new  commands. Directly - knowing what function is asking how to answer in the correct sequence.
## Results
	the results of the KickStarter_Challenge are in the REPO and chart PNGs.
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	the conclusion that i can draw from the outcomes  based on launch date is in the second quater the theater outcomes are the most successful, canceled are flat lined, not time 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	the conclusion that i can draw from the outcomes  based on goals is at the goal level the seperation of success and failure is very evident. 
	the focus should be at the higher level of goals for success.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	limitation of the data set is degree of accuraccy and where is the date kept and updated? it appears to be completely static.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	other tables or groups should be fouced on the hiher level of goals and over time (perhaps not during a world wde pandemic as this data is biased) 
	the goal of theater would have been quickly obtained.
